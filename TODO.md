# TODO:

#### admin.jade:

* ~~Set server route for editing posts~~

* Admin modal should not be escapable by clicking outside the modal dialog




#### blog.jade:

* Format post container with padding

* Include pagination at top of page as well

* Add 'first' and 'last' links to pagination links


##### index.jade:

* Include link to blog


#### Server:

* Change router to route from `index.js` instead of `server.js`

* Server crashes when there is a database error. Add try/catch blocks so this doesn't nuke everything.
